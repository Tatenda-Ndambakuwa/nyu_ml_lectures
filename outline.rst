copy cross-validation and intro to sklearn and api back in.

start of with grid-search for nearest neighbors
then go into linear models.
do exercises for classifiers plotting coefficients bla
then SGD (partial fit?)

then do grid-search over linear models for good measure
do learning curves maybe?

Do scaling and pipelines
