Introdution to scikit-learn
===========================
This is the material for my guest lecture / tutorial in Zaid 's Computational Machine Learning class.
You can find more details about the lecture here:
http://www.harchaoui.eu/zaid/teaching/nyu/fall2015/

This tutorial covers some of the tools provided by scikit-learn.

You need at least scikit-learn v0.15 and ipython v3.0 (v4 recommended) for following along with the tutorial
and doing the exercises.

If you don't already have an installation, I recommend using the anaconda distribution:

You can find a lot more information about scikit-learn on the website: http://scikit-learn.org/dev/
In particular,  you can find the user guide here: http://scikit-learn.org/dev/user_guide.html
